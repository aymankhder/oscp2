To prepare for my future job as a security pentester, I plan to get the certificate [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) next year. Before taking the exam, I need to take the course Penetration Testing with Kali Linux (PWK) provided by Offensive Security. This repo contains my notes of the journey and also keeps track of my progress.
